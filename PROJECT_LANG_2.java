// About:
// I decided to make Java the 2nd project language file for this project (Android-x32) as the model operating system (Android) heavily uses Java. I feel it is a viable platform. Due to legacy roots, Kotlin has been eliminated from Android x32, but may be available in Android x64. Java is to be used for application programming and user interfaces. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
