# I messed it up!

At the moment, almost all releases here (except for most in the 2.x range) link to a repository with `x64` in the address, instead of `x32` which means it will always return 404. I didn't notice this until over an hour in, and I can't easily go back and fix it. For now, the links will be broken, unless a pull request is made, or if development begins on a specific version of Android x32.

If you want to still use it somewhat normally without fixing it, just replace `x64` with `x32` in the URL for the affected URLs.
