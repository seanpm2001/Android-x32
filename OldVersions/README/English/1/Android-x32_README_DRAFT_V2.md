***

### Builds

Android x32 comes with 3 different builds for each Android release:

#### Heavy

#### Vanilla

Vanilla – Middle option, bootable Android image with little modification.

#### DeGoogled

DeGoogled – Removes all Google components, and phoning home methods.

##### Replacements

##### Additional build

An additional build is available as a much larger file, it allows the choice of one of the 3 builds at installation, with Live CD support.

### Android x86

Website: [`https://www.android-x86.org/`](https://www.android-x86.org/)

Android x86 is a separate project. It isn't dead, but I have specific needs for my Android setup, and I wanted to go my own way.

While this project is not functional yet, Android x86 is viable for "old" versions of Android (Android 10 and below)

***

## Hosting

Android x32 is hosted on [`archive.org`](https://archive.org/details/@android-x64) via the Android x64 account, and linked to from [`GitHub`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Android-x32/)

Hosting is done there to support the Internet Archive, and also due to limited self-host abilities at the moment.
